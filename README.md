# Pandas Data Visualization Exercise

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook assignment focused on practicing data visualization techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python. The exercises are designed to help you become familiar with various types of plots and how to customize them for effective data analysis and presentation.

## Contents
- **02-Pandas Data Visualization Exercise (1).ipynb**: The main notebook containing step-by-step exercises and solutions for data visualization using a sample dataset (`df3.txt`).
- **df3.txt**: The dataset used throughout the notebook.

## Exercises Covered
- Importing and inspecting data with Pandas
- Scatter plots
- Histograms (with and without style sheets)
- Boxplots
- Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots
- Area plots
- Customizing plot appearance (colors, styles, labels, legends, etc.)
- Bonus: Placing the legend outside the plot area

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository** or download the files to your local machine.
2. **Open the notebook** `02-Pandas Data Visualization Exercise (1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
3. **Run the first cell** to install required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) if they are not already installed.
4. **Follow the instructions** in each notebook cell. Each section contains markdown explanations and code cells to complete.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Use
- Work through each exercise in the notebook, running the code and reviewing the output.
- Modify or experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of data visualization techniques.
- Save your completed notebook before submitting or sharing.
